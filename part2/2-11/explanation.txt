I made a containerized dev and production environment for the todo-app. 
It has all the stuff needed to run and deploy this app.

There are development and production versions on each Dockerfile and docker-compose file. 

It has several services, just as:

- deno backend, 
- astro frontend, 
- postgres database with flyway migrations, 
- redis caching, 
- playwrigth e2e testing,
- nginx reverse proxy.
